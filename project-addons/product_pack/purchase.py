            The reorder variable is used to ensure lines of the same pack go
            right after their parent. What the algorithm does is check if the
            previous item had children. As children items must go right after
            the parent if the line we're evaluating doesn't have a parent it
            means it's a new item (and probably has the default 10 sequence
            number - unless the appropiate c2c_sale_sequence module is
            installed). In this case we mark the item for reordering and
            evaluate the next one. Note that as the item is not evaluated and
            it might have to be expanded it's put on the queue for another
            iteration (it's simple and works well). Once the next item has been
            evaluated the sequence of the item marked for reordering is updated
            with the next value.
